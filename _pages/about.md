I am currently pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science degree at [Northeastern University, Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu){:target="\_blank"}, Boston MA.

I received my Bachelors in Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Engineering from [K.J. Somaiya College Of Engineering](https://kjsce.somaiya.edu){:target="\_blank"} and worked as a Software Developer at [Barclays](https://home.barclays){:target="\_blank"} for three years. 

My main interests include:
- Software development (Backend APIs, applications, microservices, etc.)
- Systems programming (Operating systems, kernels, etc.)
- Tools development (Compilers, debuggers, etc.)

My goal is to develop performant, easy-to-use tools that leverage the immense potential offered by modern hardware, making overall computing experience much smoother and bloat free for users and developers.

Other than programming, I also like drawing art and playing video games.
