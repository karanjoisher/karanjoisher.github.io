I received my Bachelors in Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Engineering from [K.J. Somaiya College Of Engineering](https://kjsce.somaiya.edu){:target="\_blank"} and currently working as a Software Developer at [Barclays](https://home.barclays){:target="\_blank"}. 

My main interests include:
- Tools development (Compilers, debuggers, etc.)
- Systems programming (Operating systems, kernels, etc.)
- Graphics programming 
- Game engines

My goal is to develop performant, non over-engineered tools that leverage the immense potential offered my modern hardware, making overall computing experience much smoother and bloat free for users and developers.

Other than programming, I also like drawing art and playing video games.
